                   <p> Fantasy cricket is a strategy game, where users rely on their selection skills to pick their dream team. Thus it is considered legal (not gambling) in US and most part of the world.
                    Based on their cricketer's real-life performance in the following match, users get points and compete with others to win prizes.  Our users could still enjoy the whole experience of registering, creating their fantasy cricket team and playing in tournaments/series completely free, but now they have to use their skills to win cash prizes.
                   </p>
                    <p>Own your own team, Play your own Game.</p>


                    Good luck,
                    Team Gamithon
